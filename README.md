# Overview

I have begun a journey to learn to code in the Java language.  I have worked on SoloLearn to earn Java certificates and get a little practice with the concepts along the way.

My first Java program was a little ambitious.  This produces and GUI that takes a zipcode from the user and when Get Weather is clicked will display some basic current conditions.

My purpose for writing this software was to get experience with a GUI as well as learn how to work with API fetch outside of JavaScript. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Item 1 - Work on Displaying the Data more attractively
- Item 2 - Add relevant weather icons from the JSON data
- Item 3 - Add Forecast days and maybe even user choice of how many to view
