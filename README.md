# Overview

I have begun a journey to learn to code in the Java language.  I have worked on SoloLearn to earn Java certificates and get a little practice with the concepts along the way.

My first Java program was a little ambitious.  This produces and GUI that takes a zipcode from the user and when Get Weather is clicked will display some basic current conditions.

My purpose for writing this software was to get experience with a GUI as well as learn how to work with API fetch outside of JavaScript.
